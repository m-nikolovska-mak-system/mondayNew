# 📝 Reusable Workflow Documentation Template

This file is used as a base template when generating documentation for reusable workflows.

---

## Overview

This document provides usage instructions, inputs, outputs, and behavior for the selected workflow.

---

## Usage

(Add auto-generated documentation below. Do not modify this section manually.)

---

## Notes

* This README is auto-generated based on the workflow file.
* Any changes below the **Usage** section may be overwritten automatically.
* The header and sections above “Usage” remain intact.

---

### Why this template works

✔ Has a **Usage** header — required for your `sed` to insert text under it.
✔ Leaves clean room for auto-doc to inject its tables.
✔ Minimal enough not to conflict with auto-generated content.
✔ Works for all your workflows (ci-build, ci-upload, ci-install, etc.).
